# se_thrustcalc
Simple thrust calculator for the game [Space Engineers](https://store.steampowered.com/app/244850/Space_Engineers/) that is used mainly for calculating how many thrusters would you need for lifting and **x** weight ship up to space. 

You just input the gird size, the ship weight(optional), and the number of thrusters you have/need. Then the total lift weight is displayed and also the balance between the ship's weight and the mass of thrust.
